<h3>Our Philosophy</h3>

<p>Creating open-source Agriculture Technology is a crucial path forward to ensure the prosperity and sustainability of our planet. </p>

<h3>Why open-source is important </h3>

<p>Open-source software is software that has its source code published and licensed to allow copying and redistribution. These are many benefits to the user (farmers) that non-open-source solutions cannot have.</p>

<h3>Establishing trust</h3>

<p>Your farm data is your asset. By using an open-source product, you can be sure that your data isn't being sent or used without your consent. Others in the open-source community may inspect the source-code and ensure nothing untoward is going on. </p>

<h3>Community driven</h3>

<p>Being open-source also create an open environment around the projects. This environment allows anyone to contribute to new features. As these are already a demand for them, these new features solve real problems and not imaginary ones. The end product ends up having more useability. It also provides a space for users to make suggestions in the form of "feature requests". If a feature is too niche, a spin-off product may easily produced by another community.</p>
